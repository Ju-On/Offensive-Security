### ðŸ”´ PEH Docker lab setup and usage instructions:

    apt update
    apt upgrade
    apt install docker.io
    apt install docker-compose
if no running docker daemon then start it (assuming we have docker io / docker compose installed)

check status:

    systemctl start docker (if required)
    docker-compose up
stop container:  

    ctrl c  
have docker run in the background use -d for detached mode:  
    
    docker-compose -d
to check what dockers are running:  
    
    docker ps -a  
to stop:

    docker-compose stop
to remove a container, look for container ID and remove:

    docker rm 02dfB1w20cdcd11ee
to remove all containers:

When probing a new site, firstly understand what the function is providing. Begin by probing with common inputs ', ' ', example', " ", "example"  

Then move on to using **logical operators**  
jeremy' or 1=1#  
jeremy' or 1=1-- -  

if successful move to using **union select** and figuring out the amount of null values required to return a response  
jeremy' union select null# 
jeremy' union select null,null,null#

the third null respondes with results, indicating it has selected three coloumns in the background, loaded more information but only presenting two for us to see.
