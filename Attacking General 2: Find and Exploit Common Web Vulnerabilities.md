## Finding and Exploitation of common web vulnerabilities

### PEH Docker lab setup

    docker-up  
if no running docker daemon then start it (assuming we have docker io / docker compose installed)

check status:  

    systemctl status docker  
start docker:  

    systemctl start docker  
stop container:  

    ctrl c  
have docker run in the background use -d for detached mode:  
    
    docker-compose -d
to check what dockers are running:  
    
    docker ps -a  
to stop:

    docker-compose stop
to remove a container, look for container ID and remove:

    docker rm 02dfB1w20cdcd11ee
to remove all containers:

    docker -rm $(sudo docker ps -aq)

to reset the instance:

    localhost/init.php

#### Once PEH docker is installed, with ./permission.sh file set, run localhost from burpe browser.
