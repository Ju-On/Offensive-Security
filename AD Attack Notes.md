## üó°Ô∏è Ultimate goal is to compromise Domain (DC/AD) from basic to no access:  
* The Domain: The domain is a collection of computers and resources controlled by Active Directory, with the Domain Controller acting as the central authority for managing access, policies, and security.  
* Goal: Compromising the domain gives an attacker control over all the resources and users within that network, including Domain Admin credentials, which unlocks full network control.  
* How to Compromise: This is typically done through credential harvesting (e.g., Pass-the-Hash, Pass-the-Ticket), privilege escalation, lateral movement, exploiting misconfigurations, and leveraging attacks like Golden Ticket or Silver Ticket to gain full access to the domain.

## Key Concept

**Domain Servces:** AD DS stores directory data, manages communication between users and domains. These include user logon processes, authentication and directory searchers.

**Objects and Attributes:** Everything in AD is considered an object, each object represents a single entity. This can be a user, printer or group. Each object has attributes which are the associations attached to it.

**Organisational Units:** OUs are containers within a domain, OUs can contain users, groups, computers and other OUs. They help create a hierarchical structure within a domain and facilitate the delegation of administrative control.

**Groups:** Groups are a collection of objects, these can include users, computers and other groups. Groups help manage permissions and access to other resources in a simplified way.

**Trusts:** Trusts are established between domains to allow users in one domain to access resources in another. 

**Group Policy:** Group Policy provides centralized management and configuration of operating systems, applications, and users‚Äô settings in an Active Directory environment.

**NTLM:**  (New Technology LAN Manager) hashes are cryptographic representations of user passwords used for authentication in Windows environments. Used for network authentication and remote access, especially in legacy systems or as a fallback for Kerberos.

**NetNTLM authentication:** NetNTLM works using a challenge-response mechanism.  

**Kerberos:** A network authentication protocol designed to provide secure authentication for users and services over an insecure network. It was developed at MIT and is widely used in environments, especially in Active Directory (AD) implementations.  

* Ticket-Based Authentication
* Prevents Credential Reuse & Replay Attacks
* Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) Issued
* Requesting Service Ticket
* Accessing the Service

## AD Pentesting Methodology

**Obtaining initiall credentials**

üö© **LLMNR Attack:** 

Link Local Multicast Resolution previously called NBT-NS is a network protocol that is still in use for Windows environments for name    resolution. Operating on port 137 it is used as a fallback mechanism when DNS is not available or fails to resolve names.

The requirements to perform this attack requires LLMNR/NBT-NS protocol enabled and the attacker has to be on the same network as the target.

In order to perform this attack you need to use the Responder tool which is used to capture credentials and other sensitive information. It works by responding to certain network protocol requests, such as LLMNR/NBT-NS, and MDNS, which are typically broadcasted by devices on a local network. From the attacker machine run the below command and wait for traffic to be captured by Responder:

    sudo responder -I eth0 -dwv
    #d:enable answer for DHCP broadcast
    #w:Start the WPAD rogue proxy server
    #P: force the NTLM authentication for the the proxy  

You will then get username and hash as shown below :

Once the NTLM hashes are acquired, you can now use multiple ways to crack the hash.

    hashcat -m 5600 llmnr_hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 

üö© **SMBRelay Attack:**

A type of network attack where authentication requests and responses are intercepted between client and a server.  
It can act as a secondary attempt fall back when hash cracking has failed, as the intercepted hash can be directly relayed to authenticate with a server, removing the requirement for hash cracking.

Requirements:

* SMB signing is disabled or not enforced.

* The relayed user credentials have administrative privileges on the target machine.

* The attacker‚Äôs machine must be on the same network as the victim‚Äôs machine.

To perform this, the attacker must identify the list of machines that meet the requirements above and have it saved in a file e.g victims.txt.

Using Responder, disable SMB and HTTP in the configs file.

    sudo responder -I eth0 -dPv

launch ‚ÄúImpacket-ntlmrelayx.py,‚Äù which will take the hashes captured by Responder and relay them to the list of victims specified in the victims.txt file:

    impacket-ntlmrelayx -tf victims.txt -smb2support

When network traffic is generated, we will get hashes corresponding to the victims where the relay process has succeeded:

üö© **IPV6 DNS Takeover Attack**  

An IPv6 DNS takeover attack involves an attacker exploiting vulnerabilities in a network‚Äôs IPv6 configuration to intercept and manipulate DNS queries. By introducing a rogue IPv6 address, the attacker can redirect DNS requests to malicious servers, enabling them to eavesdrop on, alter, or redirect network traffic.

Requirements:

* IPV6 enabled : it is enabled by default in all Windows versions starting from Windows Vista.

In order to perform this attack, mitm6 and impacket-ntlmrelax can be used.  
mitm6 operates as an IPv6 DHCP server, actively monitoring the primary interface of the attacker‚Äôs machine for incoming DHCPv6 configuration requests.  

By default, Windows systems prioritize IPv6, leading them to frequently seek DHCPv6 configuration. When such requests are detected, mitm6 responds by assigning IPv6 addresses to targets within the designated domain. Additionally, it configures the attacker‚Äôs machine as the primary DNS server, thereby redirecting DNS queries through the attacker‚Äôs server.  

At this stage, we can capture the domain traffic. However, to extract credentials, we require an authentication mechanism. This is where WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery) abuse comes into play.  

WPAD is used to automatically detect the proxy configuration URL, which will be stored in a Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file. By default, the clients query the DNS server for the URL of the PAC file. If a PAC file is found, all the web requests will be routed through the proxy configured in the PAC file.  

We will host a deceptive WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Protocol) service for the victim, configuring it to assign the attacker‚Äôs IP address as the web proxy when queried. Once the connection is established, the proxy will compel the target machine to provide the NTLM challenge/response.  

Once the NTLM challenge/response pair is captured, it will be relayed to the LDAPS authentication service using impacket-ntlmrelayx. This allows us to create a new user within the Active Directory (AD), leveraging the LDAPS service installed on the AD server for authentication and user management.  

## Step 2: Enumerating Active Directory.  
Once initial credentials have been obtained, enumeration of AD can begin. Numerous tools available for this puropose include Bloodhound, Microsoft Management Consol (MMC), PowerShell, PingCastle and more.

üö© **Bloodhound:** A security tool used to map and analyze Active Directory environments. It helps identify relationships, permissions, and potential attack paths within an AD domain by visually displaying how users, groups, and computers are interconnected.  

To gather data from AD, BloodHound requires the use of a collector. Several tools are available for this purpose, including SharpHound and bloodhound-python.  

Bloodhound uses Neo4j‚Äôs graph-based data structure a to efficiently store, query, and visualize AD relationships, making it easier to identify potential attack paths and security weaknesses within an AD domain.  

üö© **Microsoft Management Console (MMC):** MMC is is a framework that provides a graphical user interface and a programming interface for managing and configuring Windows-based systems. It hosts various administrative tools, called snap-ins, which are used to manage hardware, software, and network components on a Windows operating system.

To use MMC for AD enumeration, we first need to install the Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) AD Snap-Ins.

## Step 3: Moving Laterally and Exploiting.
